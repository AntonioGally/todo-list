## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>


The "todo list" started when I was thinking of some project to apply drag and drop technology. From that moment on, I started to structure the idea and purpose of the project.
In addition to the features that I had already thought of adding, I also wanted to implement a synchronization algorithm with some database, in this case, firebase. The idea is: The app handles state changes by updating the database.
